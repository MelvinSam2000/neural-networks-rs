General:
[ ] Start using Pytorch

CNN
[ ] Code a wasm UI to test the model
[ ] Export model parameters
[x] Test nested conv layers
[x] Create CNN model with dense2d
[x] Test dense2d and compare results (bad score around 50%)
[ ] Build on GPU

RNN
[x] Test RNN (performs poorly)
[ ] Build proper tokenizer and embedding
[ ] Make RNN have good score
[x] Test Attention layer 
[ ] Build Multihead attention 
[x] Build transformer 
[x] Build positional encoder
[ ] Build LSTM layer
