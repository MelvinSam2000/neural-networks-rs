General:
[ ] Start using Pytorch

CNN
[ ] Code a wasm UI to test the model
[ ] Export model parameters
[x] Test nested conv layers
[x] Create CNN model with dense2d
[x] Test dense2d and compare results (bad score around 50%)
[ ] Build on GPU

RNN
[x] Embedding and tokenizer finish for RNN
[x] Set optimizer for RNN
[x] Set sentiment analysis dataset preprocessing
[x] Test RNN (performs poorly)
[ ] Make RNN have good score
[ ] Test Attention layer 
[ ] Build Multihead attention 
[ ] Build transformer 
[ ] Build LSTM or GRU layer
